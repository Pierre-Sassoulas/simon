This repository contains games (or educational programs) developed by my grand-father
during the 80's for his students and then later for his grand-children.
This is BASIC for Armstrad CPC or Thomson MO5.
The goal is to see if it's possible to make it run again during a retro-gaming festival
in Lyon.
